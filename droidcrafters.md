## 📝Description

The VJTI Hostels are completely managed by the hostel staff on pen and 
registers. This results into, at times loss of data and confusion. Moreover, the in-out 
entries for students are not regularly audited. 
To overcome this problem, a Hostel Management System is to be developed 
that has the following major features: <br>
• Hostel registration form filling <br>
• Room allotment Data <br>
• In-out data <br>
• Leave application data <br>
• Room chage data <br>
• Complaint Box<br>
• Hostel notice board<br>
• Attendance through App<br>
• Guest allotment <br>
• Hostel Facilities <br>
• Room change applications<br>
