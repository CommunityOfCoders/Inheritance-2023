> A blockchain-based ticketing system can address real-world problems in the ticketing industry by preventing fraud and counterfeiting, ensuring transparency, decentralizing control, providing secure and auditable transactions, using smart contracts for automation, enhancing data privacy, managing resale securely, improving user experience, and enabling interoperability between different platforms. This technology enhances the integrity and efficiency of ticketing processes while reducing risks and enhancing user control.
